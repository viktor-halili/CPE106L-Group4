Python Data Structures & Optimization Algorithms: Optimize pickup routes and donation matching using bin-packing or greedy algorithms.
Object Oriented Design: Classes for donors, recipients, food items, and logistics.
MVC Design Pattern: Maintainable and scalable architecture.
Database: Use MongoDB for managing food inventory and transactions.
API Integration: Integrate with logistics APIs (e.g., Waze, Google Maps).
Matplotlib: Visualize food saved, donor participation, and delivery efficiency.
FastAPI: Backend for managing donations, pickups, and reporting.
Flet Desktop App: Interface for donors and recipients to coordinate.
